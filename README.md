# Pathfinder-Algorithm

A C++ Program to implement Amazon's Pathfinding algorithm for it's self-driving delivery devices. A 2D-grid is created for the self-driving delivery device with a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles in between. The algorithm calculates a valid path for the device avoiding the obstacles and reaching the delivery point.
